# Simple Machine Learning Projects

## Overview
This document outlines various simple machine learning projects related to restaurant analysis and recommendations. These tasks cover regression, classification, and recommendation system techniques.

## Task 1: Predict Restaurant Ratings

### Objective
Build a machine learning model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on other features.

### Steps
- Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- Select a regression algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression) and train it on the training data.
- Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate regression metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, R-squared) on the testing data.
- Interpret the model's results and analyze the most influential features affecting restaurant ratings.

## Task 2: Restaurant Recommendation System

### Objective
Create a restaurant recommendation system based on user preferences.

### Steps
- Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- Determine the criteria for restaurant recommendations (e.g., cuisine preference, price range).
- Implement a content-based filtering approach where users are recommended restaurants similar to their preferred criteria.
- Test the recommendation system by providing sample user preferences and evaluating the quality of recommendations.

## Task 3: Cuisine Classification

### Objective
Develop a machine learning model to classify restaurants based on their cuisines.

### Steps
- Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Select a classification algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) and train it on the training data.
- Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate classification metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) on the testing data.
- Analyze the model's performance across different cuisines and identify any challenges or biases.

## Task 4: Geographical Analysis of Restaurants

### Objective
Perform a geographical analysis of the restaurants in the dataset.

### Steps
- Explore the latitude and longitude coordinates of the restaurants and visualize their distribution on a map.
- Group the restaurants by city or locality and analyze the concentration of restaurants in different areas.
- Calculate statistics such as the average ratings, cuisines, or price ranges by city or locality.
- Identify any interesting insights or patterns related to the locations of the restaurants.

## Tools and Technologies
